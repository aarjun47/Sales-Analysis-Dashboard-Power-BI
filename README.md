# Sales-Analysis-Dashboard-Project
 I have created a performance dashboard using Power BI on a sample sales data in excel format.
 I have used many visualization tools like pie chart , slicer etc. 
 I have used DAX function to create two new columns in the respected table for calculating profit and cost.
 I also used data modeling technique to create relation between tables
